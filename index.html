<br/>						
Having an avid interest towards Data Analytics/ Data Science, I am zealous towards solving problems associated with performing statistical analysis, data visualization, predictive modeling and applying machine learning algorithms to a variety of large and complex datasets. Over the course of my professional career, I've developed strong expertise in tools and techniques such as SQL, R, Python, Tableau, Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization and Predictive Modeling/Machine Learning. Being a proactive learner and team player with excellent communication, presentation and project management skills, has helped me establish my career in the field of Data analytics and Data science.<br/> 	
<br/>	
Gaining a prior corporate experience of 2 years in Oracle Development and Data Analytics, I was passionately drawn towards pursing my master's degree specializing in Data Analytics and Data Science domain. Over the last year, I've worked on numerous analytics and data science projects that involve customer data, credit score data, healthcare data, etc. This has helped me develop an extensive understanding of the various implementations of Data analytics/Data science tools and techniques.
